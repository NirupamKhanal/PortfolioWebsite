        I am an international undergraduate student at the University of Southern Mississippi, 
        pursuing a double major in mathematics and physics.

        In the future, I aspire to enter academia in both teaching and research roles. 
        My research interests include differential geometry, topology, number theory, and 
        abstract mathematics. I am also intrigued by the intersection of general relativity 
        and quantum information theory.

        More broadly, I am passionate about philosophy, psychology, social justice, and the 
        proliferation of meaningful discourse on and off campus. And I want to pursue these 
        passions academically beyond the scope of just my majors.
